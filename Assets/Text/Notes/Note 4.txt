There's a note in the ground.
"One night mom came into my room to tuck me in. She told me the monster means no harm and that showing fear makes it worse. She said it’s a sign of weakness."
"Her words comforted me but I knew it wasn't true. The monster meant harm. When mom left, I heard the monster creeping inside the house."
