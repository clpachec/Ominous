There's a note in the ground.
"I stepped outside my bedroom door and saw him heading towards mom. I quietly walked to her room trying to reassure her that she won't be harmed."
"Before I could even finish my promise, he took mom away from me. He dragged her body down to the basement. I felt alone and terrified."
